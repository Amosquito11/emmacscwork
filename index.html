<br>In the very few words i can say, i believe i've achieved a lot and thats all thanks to God.<br>
<br> I'm a very jovial individual and that has taken me to certain heights. 
 <br>I'm a staunch activist and through God almighty 2017  <br>
  <br>I was able to win the stand up comedian for the year 2017/2018 at the A.F.R.I.M.A Awards held at lagos state.<br>
<br>2015 I won an award as the writer of the year at the Stephaine Emirates Academy <br>
